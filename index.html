          <p>Later that evening I had also been privileged with a role of presenting the ISA Novice Award to two
		  freshmen who had shown both academic and leadership potential. Now I highly esteem that opportunity because 
		  it was at that very moment, when I was on the podium giving the description of the Novice award and calling out
		  the winners, that I felt this strange and compelling feeling going through my body. The kind of feeling that 
		  instantly pushed me to dig deeper inside my soul and figure out what I really wanted to do with my life. 
		  Through that feeling I was inspired to be an individual who would solve other people's problems in order to 
		  help them attain stability and security in their lives. And after going through that wonderful experience, 
		  it became clear to me that my dream was to make sure that all people had fair representation and were served 
		  in a way that enabled them to realize their dreams.

          I believe that incorporating the voice of both the rich and the poor in the governance of society is what will 
		  bring about true development. But the situation now is that the rich and the descendants of the rich have access 
		  to higher education opportunities and they continue to take leadership positions. Chances are that the kids of the 
		  rich have the same values and ideologies as their parents and they would be enforcing those same ideas generation after 
		  generation. From what we have seen already these ideologies don't work for developing countries like Malawi. Developing 
		  countries need new and improved development strategies, and it is the kids of the poor people that can bring these fresh 
		  ideas to the table if given a chance.
